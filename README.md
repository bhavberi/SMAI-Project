# Generating Music with Machine Learning

### Objectives

- Making music generation models using the following four different approaches:
    - Simple Naive Bayes
    - Vanilla Neural Network
    - Long-Short-Term-Memory RNN
    - Encoder-Decoder Model

    The objective here is to generate music that sounds similar to what humans can create without overfitting the models. There will be testing done from the given dataset as the model tries to predict the next node/chord in the sequence. Optionally, we can also get manual feedback from other people regarding the quality of the song and if it sounds human-generated.

- Music Genre Classifier
    - Building a music genre classifier for 4 genres:
        - Classical
        - Jazz
        - Metal
        - Pop
    
        We evaluate our model on 2 bases:
        - Quantitative (involves a measure of F1 Score, Precision, and Recall)
        - Qualitative (Analyzing the spread through various graphs)
    - Running the music genre classifier on the output of the Music-generation models made.
